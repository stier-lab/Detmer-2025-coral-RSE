## 🎯 Quick Scenarios

### "I want to understand the model"
1. Open [`modern_model_explorer.html`](figures/modern_model_explorer.html)
2. Start with the "Overview" tab
3. Click on each colored compartment box to learn more
4. Move through tabs 2-5 at your own pace

### "I need to present to stakeholders"
1. Open [`modern_model_explorer.html`](figures/modern_model_explorer.html) during presentation
2. Print [`model_visual_summary.html`](figures/model_visual_summary.html) as a handout
3. Reference key insights in the "Parameters" tab

### "I'm teaching a workshop"
1. Follow the 2-hour lesson plan in [`README_VISUALIZATIONS.md`](docs/README_VISUALIZATIONS.md)
2. Use [`modern_model_explorer.html`](figures/modern_model_explorer.html) for demonstrations
3. Print [`model_visual_summary.html`](figures/model_visual_summary.html) for participants

### "I'm hiring a frontend developer"
1. Give them [`MODEL_ARCHITECTURE_SPECIFICATION.md`](docs/MODEL_ARCHITECTURE_SPECIFICATION.md)
2. Give them [`VISUAL_DESIGN_SPECIFICATION.md`](docs/VISUAL_DESIGN_SPECIFICATION.md)

## 📖 Model Quick Reference

### The Core Equation
```
N(t+1) = S·(T+F)·N(t) + R
```

Where:
- **S** = Survival matrix (diagonal, size-specific mortality)
- **T** = Transition matrix (growth, shrinkage, stasis)
- **F** = Fragmentation matrix (asexual reproduction)
- **N(t)** = Population vector at time t
- **R** = Recruitment vector (new settlers)

### Four Compartments
1. **🟢 External Reefs** — Wild larval source (reference reefs)
2. **🔵 Lab** — Settlement facility (larvae → settlers)
3. **🟦 Orchard** — Nursery (growing juveniles to outplants)
4. **🔴 Reef** — Restoration site (outplanting target)

### Five Size Classes
- **SC1**: 1-20 cm² (tiny)
- **SC2**: 20-100 cm² (small)
- **SC3**: 100-300 cm² (medium)
- **SC4**: 300-600 cm² (large)
- **SC5**: 600+ cm² (huge)

### Key Parameters to Know
1. **μ** (mu) — Size-specific mortality rates
2. **κ** (kappa) — Carrying capacity constraints
3. **η** (eta) — Settlement success rates
4. **β** (beta) — Fragmentation rates
