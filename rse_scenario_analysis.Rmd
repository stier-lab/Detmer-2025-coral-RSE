README: trying out some initial scenario analyses

To start: use their current framework and vary the lab capacity (with the assumption that all recruits that fit will be kept for one year). So x-axis = lab capacity and y-axis = restoration metrics after some number of years
-- use a matrix from a growing population for the reference site and a matrix from a declining population for the intervention and control sites?
-- and repeat simulations for different mortality parameters for the first size class (e.g., shouldn't matter if they have the same mortality rates). Maybe start with values from that Chamberland paper?

-- start with no external recruitment?

NOTE: should make a function that summarizes model outputs

then repeat with disturbances? (and remember to use new disturbance function for generating disturbance parameters)
